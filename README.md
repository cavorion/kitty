Dear Kitty — Named Witness Journal (Alpha)

Purpose

Dear Kitty is a minimal, offline-first journaling interface designed for use in isolated, extreme, or low-connectivity environments. It supports emotional regulation and identity continuity through private, self-directed reflection — without analysis, feedback, or data extraction.

What it is
	•	A private journaling interface inspired by historical diaries (e.g. Anne Frank’s Kitty)
	•	A human-factors design prototype for analog missions and isolation studies
	•	A symbolic witnessing tool: users write to a named presence
	•	Offline-first, with optional timestamp-only check-in and SOS display

What it is not
	•	Not a chatbot
	•	Not a therapeutic or diagnostic tool
	•	Not an AI companion
	•	Not a data-collection platform
	•	Not a social or feedback-driven system

No journal content is analysed, transmitted, or surfaced by default.

Ethics statement

Dear Kitty is designed around autonomy, privacy, and psychological safety. All entries are private by default and remain locally stored unless a user explicitly chooses otherwise. The system does not analyse text, provide feedback, or attempt interpretation. The absence of response is intentional, preserving symbolic witnessing without dependency, authority, or surveillance. Participation is voluntary and non-evaluative.
